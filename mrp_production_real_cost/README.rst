==================================
Real costs in manufacturing orders
==================================

This module allows to manage the control of Manufacturing Orders actual costs,
by creating analytic lines as defined in the MO (from *mrp_project*).

It also updates product standard price when a manufacturing orders is finished
according this formula:

(Product stock * Product standard price + Production real cost) /
(Product stock + Final product quantity)

Installation
============

This module depends on the module *product_variant_cost_price*, that is
available in:

https://github.com/OCA/product-variant

Usage
=====

Processing a manufacture order, analytic entries adding costs will be
created when:

* Some raw material is consumed.
* A work order is finished or paused.
* Also, together with *project_timesheet* module, users time is also translated
  to costs in the linked analytic account.

The sum of all these analytic entries is the real cost:

.. figure:: mrp_production_real_cost/static/description/mrp_real_cost.png
   :alt: MRP Real Cost Details

Cost/cycle = all overhead costs associated with running one work centre cycle
(where a cycle is the Number of Cycles as calculated in the Work Order).

Cost/hr = calculated as all overhead costs associated with running the work
centre (excluding any costs covered in the cost per cycle) / the number of
hours the work centre is operating.

Pre-operation cost = Time before prod. x cost of the Pre-operation costing
product

Post-operation cost = Time after prod. x cost of the Post-operation costing
product

Itâ€™s up to the user to determine overhead costs as accurately as possible
and use all, some or none of them in order to reflect their manufacturing
process.
